**muKG** is an open-source Python library for representation learning over knowledge graphs. muKG supports joint representation learning over multi-source knowledge graphs (and also a single knowledge graph), multiple deep learning libraries (PyTorch and TF2), multiple embedding tasks (link prediction, entity alignment, entity typing, and multi-source link prediction), and multiple parallel computing modes (multi-process and multi-GPU computing).
